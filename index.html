				<h2>Hello.</h2>
				<div class="hello-row">
					<p>
						I'm a programmer. Officially, my job is to add design and
						functionality to web software. But really? I help bring people
						together and help make small business owners' dreams come true.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since I was a child, my passion has always been helping others. As a
						small-business owner, I understand how hard it can be to convince
						clients to invest in your products and services with a website that
						looks like it was designed in the '90s'. <em>Let me help you.</em>

					<h3>Design and Development</h3>
					<p>
						I first began learning how to code when I was 17 years old because I
						wanted to learn to hack. Over time, I have gained experience in Linux. I contribute to open-source projects and am looking for opportunities to create websites for businesses.

					<h3>Songwriting and Music Production</h3>
					<p>
						In my spare time, I play guitar and bass, and create electronic
						music in the same vein as hip hop and heavy metal. I am learning to
						develop artificial intelligence that creates its own music, and I can't wait to see what
						it creates!

					Are you as much of a metal nerd as me? Are you a bass-lover? Let's talk
					about it! We can code while listening to music!
